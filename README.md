TravelApp
===

This iOS app allows travel buffs to pin the countries around the world they have been to as well those they would like to visit in the future.  All on a beautiful, soft-colored map of the world, created with [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).  The app also allows you to leave notes on each pin, including dates traveled, specific places visited, and general thoughts/memories/recommendations.

This was just a side project to dip my toes in iOS development.  It was not submitted to the app store because that would require quite a bit more polishing and I didn't want to pay $99 for the Apple Developer membership.
